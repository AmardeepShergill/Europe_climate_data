## A poject in tableau looking at how worried the general poulation are about climate change and what should be done to improve it. Using a dataset given during a bootcamp project

## Worriedness dashboard
This dashboard give a general overview of what the members of the public surveyed believe are the largest issues facing them as related to climate change. These relate to some main areas of concern such as affordability, reliance on fossil fuels and other areas that could affect power output.

The pie charts illustrate the main areas of concern, such as energy affordability, reliance on fossil fuels, energy imports, and power cuts. The bar charts further break down specific threats that would cause the concern like natural disasters, insufficient power, technical failures, and terrorism.

### Conclusions 
1. General conclusions 
The index shows that as a whole the majority of people surveyed are in either "Not Very Worried" and "Somewhat" categories, with a smaller number expressing a large amount of concern regarding climate change.

2. Energy Generation 
For the concerns about the price and method of generating energy close to 70% of people show moderate or high concern, with the rise in energy prices since the survey was taken I can only imagine that this is now more. 
55-60% of people expressed some amount of worry regarding their countries current reliance on fossil fuels with less than 5%  showing the top level of concern.
A majority of people (65%) have some form of concern in relation to energy imports this has been further highlighted more recently with the conflict in Ukraine and how this has effected imports from Russia.

3.  Power availablity issues
45% of people surveryed showed some degree of concern about there being insufficient power availability though a smaller number of respondents are extremely worried about this.
When is came to power cuts over 35% of respondents had either of moderate or high level of concern about this being something that may increase

4. Potential Risks to the power supply


Technical Failures: Concerns about technical failures are moderate, with around 47% showing worry.
Terrorist Attacks: This category shows similar levels of concern, with 25-30% moderately worried, but most extreme worry compared to other issues. I will need to look further into this to see if there is a specfic country where the worry is higher and why that would then be the case 
Natural Disasters: Only about 5% show extreme worry about natural disasters, with the majority either "Not At All" or "Not Very Worried." 

## Power Generation 

In the section respondents were given five options for how much energy from different sources should be used in the national make up. The options given to them were A Very Large Amount, A Large Amount, A Medium Amount, A Small Amount, and None At All.

1. Natural Gas: The pie chart shows that most respondents prefer medium to large reliance on natural gas for energy generation. Approximately 65% support medium or higher levels of energy generation from natural gas, while about 35% suggest small to no reliance. The survey would need to be reran to see if there has been a change to this with sanctions that have been placed on Russia since the survey was completed.

2. Renewable Energy (Wind and Solar):

Wind Energy: Around 70-75% of respondents favour a large to very large amount of energy being generated by wind, indicating strong public support for this clean energy source.
Solar Energy: Similarly, solar energy has substantial support, with 75–80% advocating for a large or very large amount of solar power in the energy mix. This reflects either growing public awareness of renewable energy’s role in combating climate change or thinking that switching to renewables could bring down the price of energy as a whole.

3. Nuclear Energy: The chart shows that nuclear energy has lower levels of support compared to renewables. A majority of respondents—approximately 65–70%—favour a small amount or no reliance on nuclear energy. Only around 30–35% indicate a preference for a medium, large, or very large amount of nuclear energy in the energy mix. This reflects significant hesitancy, likely stemming from concerns over nuclear waste or potential safety issues.

4. Coal : Coal energy is the least favoured option, with approximately 70–75% of respondents suggesting a small amount or no reliance on coal. This aligns with global trends to phase out coal due to its significant carbon emissions.

## Individual Contributions to Reducing Climate Change

1. Switching off devices: Around 70–75% of respondents either "somewhat" or "very much" agree to personally switch off appliances to save energy. The personal benefit in reduced charges for energy usage may also play into this

2.  Buying energy-efficient appliances: Whopping 98% and more of participants show significant willingness ("somewhat" or "very much"), with a minority (slightly more than 1%) showing minimal interest.

3.  Personal responsibility: Over 75% feel "somewhat" or "very much" personally responsible for addressing climate change, reflecting a strong sense of accountability among individuals. #### 2. Government Policies to Reduce Climate Change The bar charts illustrate public opinions on three major climate policies:

4.  Subsidizing renewable energy (wind & solar): A significant majority (70–80%) strongly or somewhat favour subsidies for renewable energy sources, while 10–15% are against such measures. This may then be one of the best ways of changing the energy mix with initial subsidies being used to increase investment and usage of renewable energy.

5.  Increasing tax on fossil fuels: Responses are more divided here. Around 1/3(~33%) support tax increases (strongly or somewhat), a notable 43-45% oppose it. This reflects sensitivity to economic impacts as increases in taxes on energy companies would be passed onto the end users.

6.  Banning inefficient appliances: Support is high, with approximately 55–60% favouring the ban, and only 18–20% opposing it. This indicates a willingness to accept stricter regulations for environmental benefit.
