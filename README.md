# Europe_climate_data 

## A poject in tableau looking at how worried the general poulation are about climate change and what should be done to improve it. Using a dataset given during a bootcamp project

## Worriedness dashboard
This dashboard give a general overview of what the members of the public surveyed believe are the largest issues facing them as related to climate change. These relate to some main areas of concern such as affordability, reliance on fossil fuels and other areas that could affect power output.

The pie charts illustrate the main areas of concern, such as energy affordability, reliance on fossil fuels, energy imports, and power cuts. The bar charts further break down specific threats that would cause the concern like natural disasters, insufficient power, technical failures, and terrorism.

### Conclusions 
1. General conclusions 
The index shows that as a whole the majority of people surveyed are in either "Not Very Worried" and "Somewhat" categories, with a smaller number expressing a large amount of concern regarding climate change.

2. Energy Generation 
For the concerns about the price and method of generating energy close to 70% of people show moderate or high concern, with the rise in energy prices since the survey was taken I can only imagine that this is now more. 
55-60% of people expressed some amount of worry regarding their countries current reliance on fossil fuels with less than 5%  showing the top level of concern.
A majority of people (65%) have some form of concern in relation to energy imports this has been further highlighted more recently with the conflict in Ukraine and how this has effected imports from Russia.

3.  Power availablity issues
45% of people surveryed showed some degree of concern about there being insufficient power availability though a smaller number of respondents are extremely worried about this.
When is came to power cuts over 35% of respondents had either of moderate or high level of concern about this being something that may increase

4. Potential Risks to the power supply


Technical Failures: Concerns about technical failures are moderate, with around 47% showing worry.
Terrorist Attacks: This category shows similar levels of concern, with 25-30% moderately worried, but most extreme worry compared to other issues. I will need to look further into this to see if there is a specfic country where the worry is higher and why that would then be the case 
Natural Disasters: Only about 5% show extreme worry about natural disasters, with the majority either "Not At All" or "Not Very Worried."
